Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

## Peer Assessments /Getting and Cleaning Data Project

My R script called run_analysis.R does the following: <br>
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. <br>
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.<br>
5. Creates 2 files  - first with 1 column for data and 1 column for measurement type, second - separate columns for different variables<br>
6. Creates a second set of two files, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject - again 2 files.
