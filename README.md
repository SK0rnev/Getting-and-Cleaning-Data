Peer Assessments /Getting and Cleaning Data Project

My R script called run_analysis.R does the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates 2 files  - first with 1 column for data and 1 column for measurement type, second - separate columns for different variables
6. Creates a second set of two files, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject - again 2 files.
